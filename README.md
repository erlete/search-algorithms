# search_algorithms
From-scratch scenario generation for search algorithms testing.

This repository serves as scenario-generator for search algorithms testing. It includes a base array generator method composed
of random binary data values that represent "walls" and "paths" for the algorithm to search through. The array generation is
completely random, so that the data is not pre-set.

It also implements different search algorithms (currently under development) for further testing and optimization.
